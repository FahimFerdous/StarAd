                            <p>  Adhesives is a unique commodity that links grassroots
                                levels with high societies and traditional practices with
                                emerging technologies. In Bangladesh, Adhesives are using
                                as backward linkage materials for Board, Door, Leather,
                                Footwear, Plastic, Household and Paint Industries.
                                Adhesives is one of the most prospective industries in
                                Bangladesh. It has enough scope for both vertical and
                                horizontal expansion in terms of economic return and
                                social benefits. Adhesives is small capital-intensive with
                                minimum labor costs in the country. This sector occupies
                                an important position in relation to the manufacturing
                                sector in terms of gross output, value addition,
                                employment generation, poverty alleviation, income
                                generation and a socio-economic benefactor for the
                                country. However, till now Adhesives industry occupies
                                only a modest position in Bangladesh economy way below its
                                true potential. The average growth of the Adhesive
                                Industries in Bangladesh is 30%. The most common
